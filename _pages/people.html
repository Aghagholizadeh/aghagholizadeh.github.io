<p>I earned my PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida. Prior to joining LMU I did my Postdoctoral research at the University of Southern California. 
I also worked as a Lecturer at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. <img src="/images/group.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333" align="right ">
I am a registered Professional Engineer (P.E.). My works are published in various structural engineering journals and presented in national and international conferences. 
In 2018 I was awarded the American Society of Civil Engineers’ J. James R. Croes Medal for my work that was published on the ASCE Journal of Engineering Mechanics.</p>

<p></p>My research is on structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, finite element analysis, and structural health monitoring.</p>
