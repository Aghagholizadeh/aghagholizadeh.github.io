<h3>Mehrdad Aghagholizadeh, Ph.D., P.E.</h3>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Structural Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in Los Angeles, California. 
  My prior experience ranges from industry to academic research and teaching.
  I earned my PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida. Prior to joining LMU I did my Postdoctoral research at the University of Southern California. 
I also worked as a Lecturer at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. 

I am a registered Professional Engineer (P.E.). My works are published in various structural engineering journals and presented in national and international conferences. 
In 2018 I was awarded the American Society of Civil Engineers’ J. James R. Croes Medal for my work that was published on the ASCE Journal of Engineering Mechanics.</p>

<p></p>My research is on structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, finite element analysis, and structural health monitoring.</p>
