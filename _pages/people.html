<h3>Mehrdad Aghagholizadeh, Ph.D., P.E.</h3>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Structural Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in Los Angeles. My background spans academic research, teaching, and professional engineering practice. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida, where my work focused on structural dynamics and rocking systems. Prior to joining LMU, I conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Southern California and served as a Lecturer at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.</p>

<p>I am a registered Professional Engineer (P.E.). My research has been published in leading structural engineering journals and presented at national and international conferences. In 2018, I received the American Society of Civil Engineers’ J. James R. Croes Medal for work published in the ASCE <em>Journal of Engineering Mechanics</em>.</p>

<p>My current research interests include structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, rocking and self-centering systems, structural health monitoring, and high-fidelity finite element and reduced-order modeling.</p>
