The high occupancy of urban multistory buildings, the aging of critical infrastructure, and evolving safety and sustainability expectations all demand new performance objectives for civil structures. Research at the Structural Engineering and Health Monitoring (SEHM) Lab at Loyola Marymount University focuses on developing resilient, sustainable structural systems and data-informed assessment methods for buildings and bridges subjected to earthquakes and other dynamic hazards.

Our work spans: (i) rocking and self-centering structural systems for damage-limiting seismic response, (ii) physics-based digital twins and structural health monitoring for real-time condition assessment, and (iii) high-fidelity finite element and reduced-order modeling to enable efficient simulation and uncertainty quantification.
