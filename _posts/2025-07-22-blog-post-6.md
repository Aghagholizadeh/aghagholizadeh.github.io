<p>This July, I attended the 11th International Conference on Experimental Vibration Analysis for Civil Engineering Structures (EVACES 2025), held in Porto, Portugal. I presented my work titled:  
<b>"Vibration Based Damage Detection: Experimental and Finite Element Case Study."</b></p>

<p>It was a fantastic opportunity to share our recent findings with the international experimental dynamics community and to engage in discussions on system identification, modal testing, and emerging sensing technologies.</p>
